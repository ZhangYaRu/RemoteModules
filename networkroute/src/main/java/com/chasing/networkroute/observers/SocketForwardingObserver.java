/**
 * Observes a stream as a set of bytes.
 * Mirrors the up/downstream bytes to a second forwarding host.
 * The up/downstream configuration is simply defined by the configuration as to which stream this is attached to in the {@link Params} configuration.
 * This simply takes a stream of bytes and sends them to given address/host pair, discards whatever is received.
 * If you want to store/use what is returned, look into the run() method of the inner {@link Sucker} class.
 *
 * The point is to allow multiple point forwarding if you need to split traffic.
 * Really just two for now (at the time of writing this) but should work fine for more with minor mods.
 * May need a bit more testing in more complex network environments to make sure it works. But basic tests are OK so far.
